This project is an example of [Freestyle-Slick](http://frees.io/docs/integrations/slick/) integration with a Postgresql database.

## Generate

### Mapping

We are using Ã¬n this project [Slick-CodeGen](http://slick.lightbend.com/doc/3.2.0/codegen-api/index.html#package).

To generate the file `Tables.scala` with the mapping you can execute `sbt slick-gen`.

### Schema

The application generates the necessary schema to run itself and drop it when it finishes.

***Note***: Set your own user and password in `application.conf` and `build.sbt`.
